# titration-curves
An excel sheet which creates titration curves based on Concentration, Kas and volumes.

There are going to be multiple Excel sheets here. One for Monoprotic, Diprotic, and Triprotic weak/strong titrations. 
There will also be a sheet with all three in the same sheet.

Each of these sheets use macros to find the titration curves.

These equations are from Quantitative Chemical Analysis (9th ed.) by Daniel C. Harris.
